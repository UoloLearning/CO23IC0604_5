        <h2 id="B2">Book 2 : The Diary of a Young Girl </h2>
        <p>The Diary of a Young Girl, often referred to as The Diary of Anne Frank, is a book of the writings from the
            Dutch-language diary kept by Anne Frank while she was in hiding for two years with her family during the
            Nazi
            occupation of the Netherlands. The family was apprehended in 1944, and Anne Frank died of typhus in the
            Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945. Anne's diaries were retrieved by Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl. Miep
            gave
            them to Anne's father, Otto Frank, the family's only survivor, just after the Second World War was over. The
            diary has since been published in more than 70 languages. First published under the title Het Achterhuis.

            Publishing [nl] in Amsterdam in 1947, the diary received widespread critical and popular attention on the
            appearance of its English language translation, Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl by Doubleday & Company
            (United States) and Vallentine Mitchell (United Kingdom) in 1952. Its popularity inspired the 1955 play The
            Diary of Anne Frank by the screenwriters Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, which they adapted for the
            screen
            for the 1959 movie version. The book is included in several lists of the top books of the 20th century.</p>

        <h2 id="B3">Book 3 : Lord of the Flies </h2>


        <p>Lord of the Flies is a 1954 novel by the Nobel Prize-winning British
            author William Golding. The plot concerns a group of British boys who are stranded
            on an uninhabited island and their disastrous attempts to govern themselves. Themes
            include the tension between groupthink and individuality, between rational and
            emotional reactions, and between morality and immorality.
            The novel, which was Golding's debut, was generally well-received. It was named in
            the Modern Library 100 Best Novels, reaching number 41 on the editor's list, and 25
            on the reader's list. In 2003, it was listed at number 70 on the BBC's The Big Read
            poll, and in 2005 Time magazine named it as one of the 100 best English-language
            novels published between 1923 and 2005, and included it in its list of the 100 Best
            Young-Adult Books of All Time. Popular reading in schools, especially in the English-
            speaking world, Lord of the Flies was ranked third in the nation's favourite books from
            school in a 2016 UK poll.</p>
